def create_evaluators_for_documentation():
    """
    Create suite of evaluators for documentation quality assessment.

    Returns 7 specialized evaluators that measure:
    1. Conciseness alignment with reference
    2. Detail level alignment with reference
    3. Tone and style alignment with reference
    4. Structure alignment with reference
    5. Content coverage alignment with reference
    6. Terminology consistency with reference
    7. Faithfulness to source code

    Returns:
        List of LangChainStringEvaluator instances

    Example:
        >>> evaluators = create_evaluators_for_documentation()
